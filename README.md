# M4A Audio Transcriber

This project provides a simple yet powerful command-line tool to transcribe M4A audio files into text using **OpenAI's Whisper ASR model**. It leverages your NVIDIA GPU (via CUDA on WSL2 for Windows users) for faster processing and handles batch transcription of multiple files.

-----

## Features

* **High-Quality Transcription:** Uses various Whisper models (tiny, base, small, medium, large) for accurate speech-to-text conversion.
* **GPU Accelerated (NVIDIA CUDA):** Automatically uses your NVIDIA GPU for faster transcription.
* **M4A Support:** Handles M4A audio files, converting them to WAV internally.
* **Batch Processing:** Transcribes all M4A files within a specified input directory.
* **Organized Output:** Saves transcriptions as `.txt` files, mirroring original audio names.
* **Customizable Model:** Easily select the desired Whisper model via command-line arguments.

-----

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **pip**
3. **FFmpeg:**
    * **On Ubuntu (WSL2):**
      ```bash
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install ffmpeg -y
      ```
    * **On Windows:** Download from the [official FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to your system's PATH.
4. **NVIDIA GPU with CUDA (Highly Recommended):**
    * For Windows users with WSL2, follow the official guide for [CUDA on WSL](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html#getting-started-with-cuda-on-wsl).
    * Verify PyTorch detects your GPU inside WSL:
      ```bash
      python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available()); print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'No GPU detected')"
      ```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name.git
    cd your_repo_name
    ```

2. **Create input and output directories:**
    ```bash
    mkdir audios_input
    mkdir transcripts_output
    ```

    Place your `.m4a` audio files into `audios_input/`.

3. **Create and activate a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Linux/WSL
    ```

4. **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If you don't have `requirements.txt`, install manually: `pip install pydub openai-whisper`)*

-----

## Usage

Navigate to your project directory in your terminal (with the virtual environment activated).

The script `transcriptor.py` takes the input directory as a required argument.

### Basic Usage (using default 'small' Whisper model)

# Transcriptor Documentation

## Uso b√°sico

```bash
python3 transcriptor.py audios_input/
```

This transcribes all M4A files in `audios_input/` and saves `.txt` files in `transcripts_output/`.

## Specifying a different Whisper Model

Use the `--model` flag. Larger models offer higher accuracy but are slower.

**Available Models:** `tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large`

**English-only Models:** `tiny.en`, `base.en`, `small.en`, `medium.en`

### Example using the medium model:

```bash
python3 transcriptor.py audios_input/ --model medium
```

### Example using the large model and a custom output directory:

```bash
python3 transcriptor.py audios_input/ --model large --output_dir my_custom_transcripts/
```

## Getting Help

```bash
python3 transcriptor.py --help
```

## How it Works

The script converts M4A to a temporary WAV, then uses the chosen Whisper model to transcribe the audio, and finally saves the text to a `.txt` file, cleaning up temporary files.
